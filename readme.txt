This repository is a source for GCP code (python) and information on certain technologies.
Every directory is meant to focus on one technology within GCP. However, there will be overlap of technologies within each directory.
For instance, the Datastore directory will also be demonstrating code to host an app on App Engine and create APIs.
The PubSub directory will also have code for how to integrate it on Apache Airflow using Cloud Composer.

So while it may seem not all GCP matters are covered in this directory (and they totally are not all covered)
some source code and topics will spill into other areas. 

I have tested and used this code (modified) for personal and work projects. Most of which was found through the help of Google Documentation for the basics, Stackoverflow for the small issues, and Github for the crazy convoluted things.
This repository is meant as personal reference for my work, but it may as well be shared.
